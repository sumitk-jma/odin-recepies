                <li>1 cup Rice</li>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>   
            <h3>Rajma Masala</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Soak Rajma overnight (or at least for 4 hours) in about 4 cups of water. Drain the water and wash it well.</li>
                <li>Add about 3-4 cups of water, salt, and ¼ teaspoon of turmeric powder and pressure cook it for 3 whistles.</li>
                <li>Once it cools down, separate the Rajma and water.  Don't discard the water yet, as it can be used in making the gravy.</li>
                <li>Heat a saucepan. Add the whole spices like bay leaf, cinnamon, cloves. Dry roast it for a minute and remove it on a plate.</li>
                <li>Heat oil in the same saucepan.  Add the whole spices (bay leaf, cinnamon, cloves), chopped garlic, ginger, onion at the interval of 30 seconds each.</li>
                <li>Saute it well. Add chopped tomatoes (or tomato paste diluted in half a cup of water).  Add salt, ¼ teaspoon turmeric powder, garam masala powder. Saute it further. Add a few teaspoons of water if needed, so that the spices don't get burnt.</li>
                <li>Once the gravy is well cooked, add the Rajma, the Rajma paste that we made, and some or all of the saved water (from cooking rajma) depending upon how how liquidy or dry you want the gravy.  Add kasuri methi.  Bring it to a boil and then simmer it for 15 minutes. The Rajma masala is done. </li>

            </ol>
            <h3>For Making Chawal</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Soak rice for half an hour. This is an optional step, but it does help cook the rice quickly. Once soaked, wash it well couple of times and drain out all the water.</li>
                <li>Cook rice either on regular stove top, in pressure cooker or in Instant Pot. Wash rice, add water and salt. </li>
            </ol>
